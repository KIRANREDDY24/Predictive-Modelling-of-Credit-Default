# Predictive-Modelling-of-Credit-Default
Developed a predictive model to assess credit default risk using historical customer data, improving the accuracy of risk classification and decision-making.

Conducted data preprocessing including handling missing values, outlier treatment, feature engineering, and class balancing.
Applied logistic regression as a baseline model to estimate the probability of default.
Utilized advanced classification algorithms such as:
  Random Forest and XGBoost for ensemble learning to enhance prediction accuracy and capture non-linear relationships.
  Support Vector Machine (SVM) to maximize the margin between defaulters and non-defaulters.
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for instance-based learning to classify customers based on proximity in feature space.
  Naive Bayes for probabilistic classification based on conditional dependencies between features.
Performed hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation and grid search to optimize model performance.
Evaluated model performance with key metrics such as ROC-AUC, F1-score, Precision-Recall, and Confusion Matrix.
Achieved significant improvement in credit default prediction accuracy, reducing false positives and false negatives.
